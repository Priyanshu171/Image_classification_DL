# Image_classification_DL

In this notebook, the classificatioon of dogs, cats and other animals is done using Deep Learning. To achieve this, a pretrained model is used. The model VGG16 is trained on 
the imageNet dataset which has almost 1000 classes. After successfully classifying the required classes, Transfer Learning is used to classify Bo, the presidents' dog among 
other dogs. Further the model is fine tuned to improve the accuracy.
